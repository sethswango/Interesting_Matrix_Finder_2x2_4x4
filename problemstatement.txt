MATRIX CONCATENATION PROPERTY SEARCH
===================================

GOAL:
Find all pairs of 2×2 matrices A and B where their matrix multiplication result equals a matrix formed by digit concatenation.

GIVEN:
Two 2×2 matrices A and B containing single digits (1-9):

A = [a00 a01]    B = [b00 b01]
    [a10 a11]        [b10 b11]

where aij and bij are integers from 1 to 9.

STEP 1: MATRIX MULTIPLICATION
Compute matrix C using standard matrix multiplication:

C = A × B = [c00 c01]
           [c10 c11]

where:
c00 = (a00×b00 + a01×b10)
c01 = (a00×b01 + a01×b11)
c10 = (a10×b00 + a11×b10)
c11 = (a10×b01 + a11×b11)

STEP 2: CONCATENATION RULE
Form matrix D by concatenating corresponding elements:

D = [d00 d01]
    [d10 d11]

where each dij is formed by:
- Concatenating aij and bij in that order (Example: if aij=5, bij=8, then dij=58)

Note: Since we test all possible matrix pairs, solutions where B×A works will be found 
when testing that combination directly. This eliminates redundant checking while still 
finding all unique solutions.

SOLUTION CRITERIA:
A pair of matrices A and B is a solution if and only if:
1. C = D (the multiplication result equals the concatenation result)
2. All elements in both matrices are single digits (1-9)

DEMONSTRATION FORMAT (NOT AN ACTUAL SOLUTION):
The following example illustrates the format of a valid solution, but is NOT verified to be a true solution:
[6 2] × [3 1] = [63 21] = [63 21]
[1 4]   [2 5]   [12 45]   [12 45]
         ^         ^         ^
         |         |         |
    Matrix B    Matrix C   Matrix D
    (input)    (multiply) (concat)

Note: The above is merely to demonstrate the pattern we're looking for. The actual matrix multiplication may not equal the concatenation result in this specific case.

IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS:
1. Both conditions must be satisfied simultaneously
2. Only corresponding positions are concatenated (a00 with b00, a01 with b01, etc.)
3. Both forward and reverse concatenations are valid
4. The multiplication result must exactly equal the concatenation result
5. No leading zeros or multi-digit numbers are allowed in input matrices
6. All numbers must be positive integers

FUTURE WORK EXPECTATIONS
=======================

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The program must generate a text file containing:
1. Statistics section showing:
   - Total permutations tested
   - Number of matching pairs found
   - Match rate (percentage)
   - Execution time

2. Results section showing only the first match found:
   - Matrix A and B (inputs)
   - Matrix C (multiplication result)
   - Verification showing concatenation matches

PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS:
1. Solution must scale efficiently for larger matrices
2. Memory usage should be optimized for parallel processing
3. Results should be deduplicated before output
4. Progress tracking should be maintained for long-running searches

VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. All matrix elements must be single digits (1-9)
2. Matrix multiplication must be verified against concatenation
3. No leading zeros in any matrix elements
4. All numbers must be positive integers

FILE ORGANIZATION:
1. One output file per search containing all matrix sizes
2. Clear separation between statistics and results
3. Human-readable format with proper alignment
4. Timestamp of search completion
